# Code challenge: Color change boxes

### Tasks

Create a responsive page in a modern JavaScript framework (e.g. React or Vue.js)

The page must switch between the below layouts depending on the screen width. When the screen is larger than 600px the desktop layout (left) should be used, and when it is smaller the mobile layout (right) should be used. Note that the exact size and spacing of boxes doesn't matter, please use your own judgement and make something with a consistent and simple layout that looks essentially like the example

When any box is clicked, the colours of all boxes should be shuffled randomly (either to another colour in a fixed list of possibilities, or to any random colour - up to you)

You can use any styling solution for CSS (regular CSS files, CSS-in-JS, etc). However, please write the CSS from scratch instead of using a framework

Feel free to include comments to explain the intentions or thoughts behind what you're doing, and please get in touch if you have any questions.

Good luck! がんばってください！

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
